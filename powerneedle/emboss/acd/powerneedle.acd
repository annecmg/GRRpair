           are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather
           than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower
           than the gap penalty. An exception is where one or both sequences
           are single reads with possible sequencing errors in which case
           you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this result by
           setting the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
           gap extension penalty to control gap scoring."
